# cilivea-docs
Documentation for the cilivea IoT framework

# Motivation

For far too long i have irritated myself over buying smart-home devices that i can not control myself, as well as being frustrated by the limitations of other free software.

From advanced and cloud features being locked behind subscriptions regardless of self hosting, or simply these features not being part of the official spec in other open-source projects. To the API's of commercial devices being pay-to-access or really slow, like waiting 30 seconds for a light to turn on.


# Goals
The aim of this project is to create a common communication framework and structure that lends itself to expandability and tinkering by both hobbyists and commercial actors.


# Non-goals
This does not aim to be the *end all be all* iot solution, many of the implementation details are unspecified, and there are no specifiations for features in the different layers.


# Features

The software shall always remain completely accessible and open source.

If your project only uses local devices, and the local network, there will *never* be a cost in terms of software.


# Architecture
The Architecture of the Cilivea framework can be read [here](./docs/architecture.md)
